<h2>Hi there ! <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/CU-PX1m0egYAAAAC/wave-hi.gif" width="35" height="35"/></h2>

### Who am I ‚ùì

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Information Technology at [HOGENT](https://www.hogent.be/en/)., a university college located in Ghent, Belgium.

Today, data is a central pillar of modern IT. Many processes rely heavily on it ‚Äî from large language models and the Internet of Things to data-driven decision-making and data storage. In our current era, a world without data is unimaginable. This is what fascinates me and why I chose to specialize in Data Engineering & AI at HOGENT. I am now in my third and final year.

In addition to this, I also have a strong interest in cybersecurity and languages. I regularly try to expand my knowledge in cybersecurity by learning new concepts and participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. I currently speak five languages and am learning a sixth. I believe that learning a new language offers a new perspective on the world.

### Current work üî≠ 

I am currently working on my bachelor's end project. The problem I am trying to solve is the following: students are often confronted with a lot of questions when taking a course. In order to get an answer, students have three options:
- Asking to their peers: the problem with this is that the peers are not a teaching authority. This could leed to false information being spread and increase the confusion.
- Having a look at the course's documentation: courses dispose of many documentation explaining the modalities and content of the course. Rather, it seems that student are not making enough efforts to go through the documentation
- Asking to the lecturer: the final and most straightforward option students have to get an answer is to ask the lecturer. Although students will surely get the answer to their question, this is not very practical for both parties. If the lecturer receives ten times the same question, he/she will have to answer it ten times, and if the students need the answer pretty fast there is no guarantee (or obligation) that the lecturer can deliver the answer on time.

To solve this, we propose a chatbot based on Large Language Models (LLM). Due to the dynamic nature of the education, we cannot build our own LLM since this would imply retraining each time a new file is uploaded or a modification is brought to an existing file. Instead, we propose to build a Retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) pipeline which suits this environment better. To understand the concept of RAG, refer to [this](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) small article by IBM.
