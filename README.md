### Who am I ❓

I am currently persuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science at [HOGENT](https://www.hogent.be/en/), in Belgium. There, I spezialize myself in data engineering and some applied AI. 

Beside my specialisation, I am also interested in networking and cybersecurity. I try each day to broaden my knowledge in these fields by learning new stuff and doing CTF's.
